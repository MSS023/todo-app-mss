## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

My next step in this project would be to divide the app.js into components making it more efficient and add localstorage access to read cookies.

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank all my friends and mentors who've actively helped me in learning new things. Moreover I want to acknowledge the help provided by websites like https://www.stackoverflow.com and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org . It won't be possible for me to complete any project were it not for these websites.
